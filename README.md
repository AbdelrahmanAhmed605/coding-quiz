# Coding Quiz

## Description

Website displaying a timed multiple-choice Javascript coding quiz. When the user begins the quiz, they will be prompted with general questions on Javascript programming and four multiple choice answers. Correct answers are rewarded with bonus time and incorrect answers are penalized with a time deduction. Once all the questions have been answered or the time has run out, the user will be presented with their final score and a form to submit their score. User scores will be placed in the leaderboard where all scores are placed in a descending order.

During the project, Abdelrahman learnt the following skills:
- how to make changes to the DOM using javascript (appending and removing children)
- how to change style attributes within Javascript to make the webpage more dynamic 
- how to obtain elements by their id, as well as a static nodelist of all children of a particular element
- how to set and remove items from the local storage to maintain information used on the webpage
- how to use the JSON object's methods such as parsing and stringifying to alter the data to be used

To use the coding quiz website, you can click on the 'start quiz' button to begin the question prompts. At the top right, you can keep track of the time remaining for the quiz. If the timer reaches 0, or the user completes the quiz, they will be moved to the result screen where their final score is displayed. At the top left of the screen is the "view high scores" tab which when clicked will take the user to the leaderboards screen where all the user scores are displayed in descending order. On the leaderboards screen, the user has the option to go back to the home page or to clear all the scores that are currently displayed.
